How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
One way to interpret user needs is that they can do a analysis. A good way that this is acheiveable is from asking feedback from new, old and existing users. This allows them to express how they feel, and what they like and do not like about the program. Gathering this data leads us to understanding what a user is looking for and how we can give them what they want.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
I believe a good team member is one who goes above and beyond their own work to assist others who may be strugging. This can go from their coding practices to their design and mangement style. A person who can be friendly and also give supportive feedback when one needs it.
